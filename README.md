It served as a pilot project so I could learn Python and quantitative finance concepts outside of my curriculum.
The main file that includes Greeks and Probabilities has a variety of functions. It calculates all the Greeks, some by using the tree and some by using finite differences (derivatives). Additionally, there are probabilities of the individual nodes at payoff according to the binomial distribution.
